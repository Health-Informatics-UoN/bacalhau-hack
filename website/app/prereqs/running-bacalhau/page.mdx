# Running Bacalhau

The first thing the project needs to achieve is getting Bacalhau up and running locally.

Once as a project team we complete this step:

1. This page can turn into a "getting started" guide
2. The Project Team can move on to further activities

## Getting Started

Bacalhau has pretty great (albeit not perfect) documentation.

However here we have distilled some guidance to getting started as quick as possible for our purposes.

### Running the CLI

Lots of things\* in Bacalhau are handled through its CLI:

- Running nodes
- Configuring the network
- Submitting jobs to a network
- ...

\* Some things can be done via the REST API of an Orchestrator node (which in turn is run by the CLI!)

It's easy to run the CLI both locally or in a docker container:

<Tabs items={['Local', 'docker run']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   
  <Steps>
  #### Install locally

e.g. `curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash`

[Installation docs](https://docs.bacalhau.org/getting-started/installation/step-1-install-the-bacalhau-cli#install-the-bacalhau-cli)

#### Run the CLI

e.g. `bacalhau version`

[CLI Guide](https://docs.bacalhau.org/references/cli-reference)

  </Steps>

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

You can `docker run` the Bacalhau container image and simply provide CLI arguments.

e.g. `docker run -it ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/bacalhau:latest version`

<Callout>
  Depending on what you're asking the CLI to do, you may need additional
  arguments to `docker run`, such as volume mounts or port mappings.
</Callout>

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Running a Private network

Bacalhau essentially configures a compute network of connected nodes.

Node hosts can be however localised or distributed as you want, in a variety of environments.

You could imagine, for example, a federated network of TREs, where a "front door" TRE hosts a Bacalhau Orchestrator node, and each TRE runs a Bacalhau Compute node connected to that Orchestrator?

(cf. TRE-FX, DARE UK Blueprint architecture etc.)

To run a Private Network locally:

<Tabs items={['Local single node', 'Local devstack', 'docker run devstack']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   
   You can actually start a single Orchestrator and a single Compute node at the same time from one CLI process:

  `bacalhau serve --orchestrator --compute`

  The Orchestrator API will be accessible at `http://localhost:1234`

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  Bacalhau offers a helpful way to set up a local development network of 3 Compute nodes and an Orchestrator, all from one CLI process.

  <Steps>
  #### Configure the CLI

  The docs advise to set this, to ensure the Orchestrator node listens on a known port, but the behaviour appears to differ from the docs - it seems to listen on `1234`.

  `export PREDICTABLE_API_PORT=1`

  #### Run the CLI

  `bacalhau devstack`
