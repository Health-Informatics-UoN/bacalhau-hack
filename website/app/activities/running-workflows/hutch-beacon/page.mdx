# Hutch Beacon

We tried running our Hutch Beacon Resolver (A GA4GH Beacon API Request resolver).

First we tried just asking Bacalhau to run the docker image for this tool directly.

We encountered learning opportunities in the form of needing to pass environment variables as well as cli arguments.

## Getting the container image running

Example command for running:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/bacalhau:latest docker run --api-host host.docker.internal --wait -e DATASOURCE_DB_USERNAME=postgres -e DATASOURCE_DB_PASSWORD=postgres -e DATASOURCE_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal -e DATASOURCE_DB_SCHEMA=omop -e DATASOURCE_DB_PORT=5432 -e DATASOURCE_DB_DATABASE=omop hutchstack/beacon-omop-worker:latest --entrypoint beacon-omop-worker -- individuals --filters "Gender:F,SNOMED:386661006,SNOMED:271825005"
```

This run successfully but fails to connect to the database and produce an output.
