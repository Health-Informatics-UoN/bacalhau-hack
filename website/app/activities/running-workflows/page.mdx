# Running Workflows

<Callout type="info">
  This Activity will require familiarity with Computational Workflows, e.g. using languages/engines such as Common Workflow Language (CWL), Nextflow etc.

Bacalhau is for running workflows.

We as a team, for both HDR UK and ELIXIR programmes, are interested in running workflows across standardised software stacks, often in federated environments.

We have some simple workflows suitable for federated usage that we would like to try and run using Bacalhau.

It would also be of interest to gauge how easy it is to run other workflows of different kinds.

## Bunny Cohort Discovery Workflow (HDR UK Cohort Discovery Tool)

We have experience running this CWL workflow via `cwl-tes` (with a GA4GH TES Backend) and Elixir's WfExS.

Let's explore running it on Bacalhau!

## &lt;Your Analysis Here&gt;

What other workflows can you explore running on Bacalhau?
