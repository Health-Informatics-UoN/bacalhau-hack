# Gap Analysis

<Callout type="info">
  This Activity will require familiarity with one or more of:

  - Existing Workflow Execution Tools
  - Federated Analysis environments
  - Secure Processing, Data or Trusted Research Environments (TREs etc.)
</Callout>

As this project seeks to assess the suitability of Bacalhau for use in Federated Analysis, particularly in Secure environments (e.g. TREs),
we need to understand the gaps in Bacalhau against our needs.

There are two main angles for this:

1. Gaps in Bacalhau against other existing workflow tools
1. Gaps in Bacalhau against Federated or Secure (TRE) needs.

## Gaps vs existing tools

As a starter, we can consider comparing Bacalhau against tooling we have used for Cohort Discovery workflows previously.

Comparisons with other workflow tools is also welcome.

### WfExS

`// TODO:`

### TES (e.g. TES-K, Funnel)

`// TODO:`

## Gaps vs TRE requirements

As a starter, we can consider the ease of integrating Bacalhau with the HDR Fed A stack (or the earlier TRE-FX stack).

Any analysis concerning being able to use Bacalhau in Trusted Research Environments is also welcome.

## HDR Fed A / TRE-FX
