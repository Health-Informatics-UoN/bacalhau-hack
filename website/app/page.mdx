# Hackathon
 
Through hands-on hacking, perform a detailed, practical investigation of Bacalhau (https://www.bacalhau.org/) - a software solution for 
distributed compute over data - aiming to achieve technical goals and report on outcomes as detailed below.
 
At minimum, this will involve testing usage with existing open source computational workflows and tools for Cohort Discovery
as developed at the University of Nottingham.
